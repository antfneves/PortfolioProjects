As part of the Data Engineering Capstone Project from Coursera, I assumed the role of the Associate Data 
Warehouse Engineer who has recently joined an e-commerce organization. 
You will be presented with a business challenge that requires 
building a data platform for retail data analytics. 
In this Capstone project I: 
Designed a data platform that uses MySQL as an OLTP database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database, 
Designed and implement a data warehouse and generated reports from the data, 
Designed a reporting dashboard that reflects the key metrics of the business, 
Extracted data from OLTP and NoSQL databases, 
Transformed it and loaded it into the data warehouse, and then create an ETL pipeline, 
and finally, created a Spark connection to the data 
warehouse and then deployed a machine learning model. 
In Module 1, 
Design the OLTP database for an e-commerce website, 
populate the OLTP Database with the data provided, and 
automate the export of the daily incremental data into the data warehouse. 
In Module 2, 
Set up a NoSQL database to store the catalog data for an E-Commerce website, 
load the E-Commerce catalog data into the NoSQL database, and 
query the E-Commerce catalog data in the NoSQL database. 
In Module 3, 
Design the schema for a data warehouse based 
on the schema of the OLTP and NoSQL databases. 
Create the schema and load the data into the fact and dimension tables, 
automate the daily incremental data insertion into the data warehouse, and 
create Cubes and Rollups to make the reporting easier. 
In Module 4, create a Business Intelligence dashboard. 
Create a Cognos data source that points to a data warehouse table, 
create a bar chart of quarterly sales of cell phones, 
create a pie chart of sales of electronic goods by category, and 
create a line chart of total sales per month for a given year. 
In Module 5, 
you will extract data from an OLTP, NoSQL, and MongoDB databases into CSV format. 
You will then transform the OLTP data to suit the data warehouse schema, and 
then load the transformed data into the data warehouse. Finally, 
you will verify that the data is loaded properly. 
In the sixth and final module, 
you will use your skills in Big Data Analytics to create a Spark connection to the data warehouse 
and then deploy a machine learning model on SparkML for making sales projections.

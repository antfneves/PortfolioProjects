## AUTOMATE LOADING OF INCREMENTAL DATA INTO THE DATA WAREHOUSE
In this assignment, I performed a number of tasks such as:  

-	Connected to IBM DB2 data warehouse and identified the last row on it.
  
-	Connected to MySQL staging data warehouse and found all rows later than the last row on the datawarehouse.
  
-	Inserted the new data in the MySQL staging data warehouse into the IBM DB2 production data warehouse.

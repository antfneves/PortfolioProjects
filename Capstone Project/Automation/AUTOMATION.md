## AUTOMATE LOADING OF INCREMENTAL DATA INTO THE DATA WAREHOUSE

You need to keep data synchronized between different databases/data warehouses as a part of your daily routine. One task that is routinely performed is the sync up of staging data warehouse and production data warehouse. You will be given a set of python scripts to start with. You will use/modify them to perform the incremental data load from MySQL server which acts as a staging warehouse to the IBM DB2 which is a production data warehouse. This script will be scheduled by the data engineers to sync up the data between the staging and production data warehouse.

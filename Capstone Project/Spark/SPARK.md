In this assignment, i performed a number of tasks to analyze search terms on the e-commerce web server. 
I worked in Watson Studio within a Jupyter notebook to run analysis against a CSV 
file containing the webserver data. 
I loaded this file into a Spark data frame and printed the results of queries against this data set. 
Then I loaded a pretrained sales forecasting model and used this to predict the sales for the next year.
